            <p>Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and the nearest to the Sun.

                Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. Its surface is covered in tens of thousands of impact
                craters. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system – that
                title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere. But Mercury is the fastest planet,
                zipping around the Sun every 88 Earth days. Mercury is appropriately named for the swiftest of the
                ancient Roman gods.</p>

        <div class="midcontent">
            <p>Earth, our home, is the third planet from the sun. While scientists continue to hunt for clues of life beyond Earth, our home planet remains the only place in the universe where we've ever identified living organisms. 

                Earth is the fifth-largest planet in the solar system. It's smaller than the four gas giants — Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune — but larger than the three other rocky planets, Mercury, Mars and Venus.
                
                Earth has a diameter of roughly 8,000 miles (13,000 kilometers) and is mostly round because gravity generally pulls matter into a ball. But the spin of our home planet causes it to be squashed at its poles and swollen at the equator, making the true shape of the Earth an "oblate spheroid."</p>
